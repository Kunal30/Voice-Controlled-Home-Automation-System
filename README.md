# Voice-Controlled-Home-Automation-System
In this project we will simulate a system that would enable the control of electronic appliances in our home using voice commands over a smart phone. This includes appliances like lights, fans etc. and may be extended to other appliances. For our project, we will implement a system where different coloured LEDs (may represent lights in different rooms of the house) and small electric motor (acting like a fan) will be operated using simple voice components given to a smart phone. These commands will be transmitted through Bluetooth to the Arduino which will process them.
